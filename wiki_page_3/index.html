    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Virginia is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. It is known for its rich history, natural beauty, and diverse culture.</p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>Virginia's educational system consistently ranks in the top five states on the U.S. Department of Education's National Assessment of Educational Progress, with Virginia students outperforming the average in all subject areas and grade levels tested.[391] The 2021 Quality Counts report ranked Virginia's K–12 education thirteenth in the country, with a letter grade of B-.[392] Virginia's K–7 schools had a student–teacher ratio of 12.15:1 as of the 2021–22 school year, and 12.52:1 for grades 8–12.[393] All school divisions must adhere to educational standards set forth by the Virginia Department of Education, which maintains an assessment and accreditation regime known as the Standards of Learning to ensure accountability.[394]

      Public K–12 schools in Virginia are generally operated by the counties and cities, and not by the state. As of the 2022–23 academic year, a total of 1,263,342 students were enrolled in 2,381 local and regional schools in the Commonwealth, including 57 career and technical schools and 411 alternative and special education centers across 126 school divisions. Besides the general public schools in Virginia, there are Governor's Schools and selective magnet schools. The Governor's Schools are a collection of 52 regional high schools and summer programs intended for gifted students,[395][396] and include the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, the top rated high school in the country in 2022.[397] The Virginia Council for Private Education oversees the regulation of 483 state accredited private schools.[398] An additional 50,713 students receive homeschooling.[399]
      
      In 2022, 92.1% of high school students graduated on-time after four years,[400] and 89.3% of adults over the age 25 had their high school diploma.[3] Virginia has one of the smaller racial gaps in graduation rates among U.S. states,[401] with 90.3% of Black students graduating on time, compared to 94.9% of white students and 98.3% of Asian students. Hispanic students had the highest dropout rate, at 13.95%, with high rates being correlated with students listed as English learners.[400] Despite ending school segregation in the 1960s, seven percent of Virginia's public schools were rated as "intensely segregated" by The Civil Rights Project at UCLA in 2019, and the number has risen since 1989, when only three percent were.[402] Virginia has comparatively large public school districts, typically comprising entire counties or cities, and this helps mitigate funding gaps seen in other states such that non-white districts average slightly more funding, $255 per student as of 2019, than majority white districts.[403] Elementary schools, with Virginia's smallest districts, were found to be more segregated than state middle or high schools by a 2019 VCU study.[404]</p>

    <p>In the 17th century, Virginia became a major tobacco-producing colony and played a significant role in the growth of the American colonies. The cultivation of tobacco led to the establishment of large plantations and the use of enslaved labor, shaping Virginia's social and economic landscape.</p>

    <p>During the American Revolutionary War, Virginia was a key player in the fight for independence. Many influential figures, such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Patrick Henry, hailed from Virginia and played crucial roles in the formation of the new nation.</p>

    <p>Virginia's history also includes its involvement in the Civil War. The state seceded from the Union in 1861 and joined the Confederacy. Several major battles, including the Battle of Bull Run and the Battle of Gettysburg, took place on Virginia soil. The war had a lasting impact on the state and its people.</p>

    <p>After the Civil War, Virginia went through a period of Reconstruction and faced challenges such as racial tensions and economic recovery. The state gradually rebuilt and diversified its economy, becoming a hub for technology, defense, and other industries.</p>

    <h2>Geography</h2>
    <p>Virginia is located in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions of the United States.[88][89] Virginia has a total area of 42,774.2 square miles (110,784.7 km2), including 3,180.13 square miles (8,236.5 km2) of water, making it the 35th-largest state by area.[90] The Commonwealth is bordered by Maryland and Washington, D.C. to the north and east; by the Atlantic Ocean to the east; by North Carolina to the south; by Tennessee to the southwest; by Kentucky to the west; and by West Virginia to the north and west. Virginia's boundary with Maryland and Washington, D.C. extends to the low-water mark of the south shore of the Potomac River.[91]

      The Commonwealth's southern border is defined as 36°30' north latitude, though surveyor error in the 1700s led to deviations of as much as three arcminutes as the North Carolina border moved west.[92] Surveyors appointed by Virginia and Tennessee worked in 1802 and 1803 to reset the border as a line from the summit of White Top Mountain to the top of Tri-State Peak in the Cumberland Mountains. However, errors in this line were discovered in 1856, and the Virginia General Assembly proposed a new surveying commission in 1871. Tennessee's representatives preferred to keep the 1803 line, and in 1893, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in their state's favor in the case Virginia v. Tennessee.[93][94] One result of this is the division of the city of Bristol between the two states.[95]</p>
